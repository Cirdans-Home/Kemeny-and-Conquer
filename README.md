# Kemeny-and-Conquer
Computation of Kemeny's constant using censored Markov Chains

## Hutch++

Some of the tests make use of the stochastic trace estimator called Hutch++. The repository with related code is added as a git submodule. If you use that version of the algorithm for estimating the Kemeny constant, you should also cite the original article:
